# CryptaShield: Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Tool

## Overview
CryptaShield is a simple yet effective web tool designed for converting plain text into cipher text using the Caesar cipher encryption technique. This project was developed from January 2022 to April 2022 with the aim of providing a user-friendly solution to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.

## Features
- **Caesar Cipher Encryption:** Easily convert your plain text messages into cipher text to enhance the security of your communications.
- **Decryption Functionality:** Decrypt cipher text back to the original message using the same Caesar cipher algorithm.
- **User-friendly Interface:** The web tool is designed with a clean and intuitive interface for a seamless user experience.

## Technology Stack
- **HTML:** Structuring the web pages.
- **CSS:** Styling and layout for an aesthetically pleasing design.
- **JavaScript:** Implementing the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption functionality.

## How to Use
1. Open the CryptaShield website in your preferred web browser.
2. Enter your plain text message in the provided input field.

### Example
- **Original Message:** `pizzapizzapizza`
- **Shift:** Choose a numeric value for the Caesar cipher (e.g., 3)

3. Choose the encryption key (shift value) for the Caesar cipher.
4. The encrypted message will be directly shown as: `slwwdslwwdslwwd`

### Decryption Example
- **Encrypted Message:** `slwwdslwwdslwwd`
- **Shift:** Same numeric value used for encryption (e.g., 3)

5. Enter the encrypted message in the input field.
6. Choose the decryption key (shift value) for the Caesar cipher.
7. The decrypted message will be directly shown as: `pizzapizzapizza`
